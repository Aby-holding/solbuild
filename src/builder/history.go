// PackageHistory is an automatic changelog generated from the changes to
// the package.yml file during the history of the package.
//
// Through this system, we provide a `history.xml` file to `ypkg-build`
// inside the container, which allows it to export the changelog back to
// the user.
//
// This provides a much more natural system than having dedicated changelog
// files in package gits, as it reduces any and all duplication.
// We also have the opportunity to parse natural elements from the git history
// to make determinations as to the update *type*, such as a security update,
// or an update that requires a reboot to the users system.
//
// Currently we're only scoping for security update notification, though
// more features will come in time.

// repository path, and return a usable instance of PackageHistory for writing
// to the container history.xml file.
